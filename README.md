# Surfs_up
## Project Overview

This project provides an upcoming investor of a surf and ice cream shop with a weather analysis on the island of Oahu, Hawaii. Statistics are provided for June and December, the peak tourism months, to determine whether the ice cream and surf shop will have good weather conditions in which to operate.

## Resources

* [hawaii.sqlite](hawaii.sqlite)

## Development Environment

* Flask
* Jupyter Notebook
* Python SQL Lite
* SQLAlchemy


## Deliverable 1: Determine the Summary Statistics for June

Temperatures for the month of June are summarized in *Table 1* below.

|| June Temps |
| ------ | ---------- |
|count |	1700.000000|
|mean | 74.944118|
|std	| 3.257417|
|min	| 64.000000|
|25%	| 73.000000|
|50%	| 75.000000|
|75%	| 77.000000|
|max	| 85.000000|

## Deliverable 2: Determine the Summary Statistics for December

Temperatures for the month of December are summarized in *Table 2* below.

|| December Temps |
| ------ | ---------- |
|count | 1517.000000|
|mean | 71.041529|
|std	| 3.745920|
|min	| 56.000000|
|25%	| 69.000000|
|50%	| 71.000000|
|75%	| 74.000000|
|max	| 83.000000|

**Table 2: December Temperatures**

## Results

The results of the weather analysis are as follows:

* The average temperatures for June and December are 74.9 F and 71.0 F, respectively, a difference of approximately 4 degrees.
* The minimum temperatures are 64.0 F and 56.0 F for the months of June and December, respectively.
* The maximum temperatures 85.0 F and 83.0 F for the months of June and December, respectively.


## Summary

June and December have similar weather patterns. Both months exhibit warm temperatures, ideal for grabbing an ice cream cone after a day of surfing.

W. Avy, the upcoming investor, expressed his concern for the amount of precipitation on Oahu. He specified there needs to be enough rain to keep everything green, but not so much that you lose out on that ideal surfing and ice cream weather. Analyses on precipitation in June and December are summarized in *Table 3* and *Table 4* below:

|| June Precipitation |
| ------ | ---------- |
|count | 1574.000000|
|mean | 0.136360|
|std	| 0.335731|
|min	| 0.000000|
|25%	| 0.000000|
|50%	| 0.020000|
|75%	| 0.120000|
|max	| 4.430000|
